5 AM, with pain shooting through your neck, and achy tightness all through you neck, shoulders, and back, it's not exactly the "right side of the bed". I stretch and move - I feel all rusted shut angles, trying to pry everything open so I can breathe. Everything hurts. I stretch and my bladder aches sharply. I step out of bed, pain shoots up my legs from my feet - specifically, the way my muscles are all pulled so taught, it's like my bones are hitting the floor with my nerves in between. I go pee, and it hurts, because my bladder is muscle and connective tissue, it's all tight and pulled and stretched. It aches like it's been over-extended for days, but I was just up a few hours before. I stretch my chest through the doorway, once, twice, trying to breathe. </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="57"><p>I think about how frustrating it is to be in so much pain, how insurances don't cover the actual treatments that help, and doctors don't really know what to do.
