My dad would say, "pay attention" in a commanding voice. I came to realize that his pointed (literally, he would point at you when he said it) phrase was his statement of "be here now". He was always focused on safety, and did things meticulously. He didn't care for the distractions that phones have brought into our lives. He would remind others to keep their mind on their task, and "safety first". They were important things when you're working in a coal mine, or with heavy machinery and tools, but this sentiment carried through his life, and he strived to impress this upon others.

Mindfulness practices weren't something I would always associate with my dad, but he just had his own, more direct, way of going about it. Now, I think of these words, and all the love behind them, the intention for awareness. Pay attention. Just take a moment to pay attention. Be mindful. When you continue in the next moment, do it with awareness and purpose. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/329be80c-f302-4266-921d-ef455bee5453.jpg)
