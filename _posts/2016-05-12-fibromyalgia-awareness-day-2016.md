I'll save my full thoughts on inclusiveness for another post, but I want to share how very important it is to speak on this subject regarding those who suffer with fibromyalgia. 

I'm not sure how to explain this better, but I will say that my husband absolutely gets this right. Where I find myself frustrated with the other ways people "handle" me, I don't with him. _( Trust me, I'm totally aware how I am lucky here - and so grateful that he is giving, compassionate, and understanding)._

I guess what makes it so different with my husband, over all else, is that he always abides with me, allowing me to go through whatever I am going through, without seeing me as something other than myself. He doesn't handle me with fear. He respects that I will tell him when I'm too tired to do something, and he respects that I know what I need. He helps and takes care of me without telling me I'm doing things wrong. 

What we need are people who will be with us, whatever we are going through, without diminishing our experience through various means of invalidation. We need people in our lives that support us, encourage us, yet remain realistic - when I talk to you about my state of being, it's unrealistic to say things like, " I hope they find a cure!" When you are overly positive or negative in an attempt at sympathy, it just makes us feel invalidated or ignored.

This illness is something I have accepted that I have to live with. If it's in remission, I'll still have to live with it. I need the people in my life to accept it too. It's part of my thought process, what might I need if I start to feel worse while I'm out, what do I need to take with me, what is my alternate plan in case I need to come home and I'm out with someone, where can I comfortably rest, will I be affected by the environment there, etc. These are legitimate concerns. These things truly affect me and my ability to do things, not just today, but if I push myself today, it affects tomorrow, the rest of my week... and I need to be in charge of when I use my spoons and for what. I need you to respect these decisions.

**Inclusiveness is about acceptance, and empathy, and respect for one's autonomy - _and it's SO IMPORTANT to us_**. 

Some days, _this is all we have_, the decisions we make to rest, to say no to activities and yes to self-care. We may be reduced to a pile of used spoons, and we need you to support that if you want to remain in our lives and be helpful. 

The theme of Fibromyalgia Awareness Day this year "Your Voice Matters". Please make an effort to listen to our voices, individually and collectively, so that this thing is better understood and treated, and definitely to help end discrimination against a suffering population.
