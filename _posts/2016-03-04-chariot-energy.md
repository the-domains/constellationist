Today I drew the chariot card, reversed, of course. It's just how things have been lately. The different meanings this could take on all point to the same thing - awareness of the chariot inside you.  The energy of this card is about the ideas of the will, confidence, focused energy, and the flow that occurs on the way to triumph. With that in mind,  I created this sigil from the word "TRIUMPH" to encompass the energy of the chariot and manifest it in my life. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6c44b3d6-c643-493c-a4a8-4608b1b88d9e.jpg)

I like to use the time I spend creating my sigils to focus my awareness on what they are bringing to my life. This one feels to me like a switch - awareness that I need to stop distracting myself, get focused, grounded, and hop on.
