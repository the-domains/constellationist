There are so many times that I want to speak up, but I've kept quiet, because I didn't feel it was my story to tell.  I share it now, with permission, in hopes that someone else might have that moment that helps them put everything in perspective, that this story adds to the development of our mutual understanding and collective empathy. 

My husband and I have been together since we were in high school. A lot of people have asked us how we get along so well, how we have such a good relationship - and I will tell you, it isn't always easy, but it's based on choosing love each time you're faced with a decision, respect, acceptance, kindness... these are all things that have helped us. 

My husband tells me that I'm the most understanding human being that exists. I just think that it's in my heart, the want to understand, and to be understood. And I want that for everyone. This is what pulls at my heart to speak up, and say, _**my husband is on the spectrum**_. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/74f2e722-4873-49cc-93e6-63facbb16050.jpg)

He loves animals. He'll stop and rescue a bunch of baby raccoons whose mother has been hit. He'll kiss a friends cat that he just met. He'll cuddle any kitten, puppy, squirrel... pick up any frog, lizard, spider... He will stop and rescue half a dozen baby turtles hatching by the road and relocate them somewhere safe - in a rain storm. I adore him for all of this.   
He doesn't like hugs from people, he doesn't think babies are cute, doesn't want to hold them, doesn't want people to touch him in general. We joke that none of us know how I ever got in. He says I "feel like a cat" to him. That's the best way we have of understanding it, and that's okay with me. 

My husband is good at math, remembering numbers, is very picky about what he wears and eats. His food can't touch, he will listen to the same music and read the same books, over and over. He has to decide to be spontaneous. He speaks in movie quotes and song lyrics. He's really good at strategy games. He is incredibly sarcastic, but can't understand when other people are being sarcastic, or most other nuanced emotional things.  Much of the time, people don't know when HE is being sarcastic, and I'm often among them. 

There are a lot of things about him that are "different". He has always been hard on himself about the things that interfere with his daily life. Anxiety, when his schedule gets messed up, when something happens and he just can't continue...

We knew he'd been through a lot as a child... also he'd been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder, ADHD, social anxiety, digestive issues, chronic headaches... but no one knew much then, about autism, especially on the "high functioning" end of the spectrum. Even when I studied to be a therapist in grad school, I wasn't aware of what autism looked like in adults on that end of the spectrum. No one put together how much all of this had a common core.

We had watched a few movies with Aspie portrayals, and they left him feeling connected with those characters. He expressed that was how he felt, or did things. We talked about it, but it wasn't until one of our nephews was born, that I really started to see it. The little guy expressed traits of autism really early, and as he grew, I couldn't believe how much like his uncle he was with his mannerisms. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a79a6273-79d3-4808-a90a-2e5dcc6a761a.jpg)

Then, I worked with a woman who constantly told me that my husband was so much like her son, who has autism. ... It's weird how you can know adults who have autism, yet be married to one, or be one, and not see it. Then there's the night where, you are seeking for understanding, and you just Google, "does my husband have autism", and it's an Aha! moment where you read through descriptions of other people's lives that could totally be yours. 

Viewing him through this lens helps me understand him better, and be a better advocate for him. When people think he's being rude, and he realizes it, he often tells them he's just autistic, and he probably misunderstood. I feel like there is less frustration with his behaviors when you know more about them. His friends get it, and when he feels like telling someone new, they seem to understand him better too. It makes me happy, because I love this brilliant, adventurous, kind-hearted man, and I want everyone else to have that experience as well. 

There are lots of people out there going through life with autism, and lots of people who are related to, or married to, someone on the spectrum, undiagnosed - just ask Google. Awareness can help all of us better understand and help one another. We just presented the box of thoughts on autism here, not even opening the lid on all the difficulties for adults, relationship specifics, etc. I hope to share more of our story in the future.
