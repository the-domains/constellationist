I hope this visual representation of visual effects helps some people understand what migraines really are like. It's also frustrating that people who don't have them use the word interchangeably with the word "headache". They are not the same at all. 

Keep in mind, this is visual representation, which comes with severe pain, mood fluctuation, cognitive impairment... for me, being super sensitive to everything anyway, I try to track my migraine triggers, and minimize things that will lead to a migraine cycle. 

My own symptoms often start with the visual aura, that semi-circular bright light/flashing, geometric looking lines - if you look at someone's face, it's like your brain mixes up all the signals, it's frightening to see their face distorted, words distorted... if I read things, it seems like the page is sliced, and floating apart. My ears ring. When it's really bad, I can't make sense of words that I see, they feel backwards. My body doesn't feel right, things feel heavy and numb. When the pain comes, it feels like someone is stabbing my brain with a knife, and beating my head with a rubber mallet at the same time. Nausea and throwing up are common, which is why I try to minimize all sensory input and try to sleep.

All of this compounds with my fibromyalgia symptoms, wreaking havoc on me... Migraine cycles are typically from one to 6 weeks, with changing symptoms, not always accompanied by migraine pain. _**Meanwhile, I look fine... **_

Please take a moment to watch, and remember what others are going through when they say they are experiencing a migraine.
