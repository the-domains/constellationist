Fibromyalgia makes me feel way less capable and confident than I used to feel. After all I've been through, I'm having a difficult time feeling "safe". 

I'm low on the spectrum of tolerance for things (noises, smells, lights, etc.) and I can't control my environments, but I try to choose them the best I can for optimal nervous system friendliness. I feel safer when these things are things I can have a say in, and when I'm with people who understand what will happen to me if I don't listen to my body. It's scary to have to rely on other people, but there are points where I am so fatigued that I don't have a choice. 

I'm also low on the spectrum of what I can deal with emotionally. If someone is not going to be supportive and caring, I simply don't have time or energy to deal with it. I think a lot of people don't get this point, how pivotal in our bodies that emotional stress can be. We are strong people, us fibromites/sensitives/empaths, SERIOUSLY STRONG - to go through all we do every single day, but that line that crosses our thresholds can be so thin. We are always striving for more self-awareness and insight on our limits, and all the things that affect them. 

Thus, being somewhere that you feel supported is vital to our well being. Even if people don't understand what we are going through, how it feels, they can still be supportive of our needs. One of the most loving, kind things anyone can do is ask, "what do you need?" Be open. Be honest. These people really care about you, and _they are trying_.

Also on the idea of  "feeling safe", I realize that it is relative. Our idea of safety is generally an illusion, much of it is way beyond our control. When you think about it this way, letting go can be freeing. Be aware of the things that are in your control. List making is ever helpful! 

I've made a list sheet you can use to get you started looking at what you can do, and what you can let go of.  My examples are in the boxes, clear them out and use this tool for yourself. [_CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD_][0]
