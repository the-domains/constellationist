You know what I have in common with transgender individuals? A LOT. We're human. Know what else? People with Fibromyalgia and people who are transgender are both high risk populations. I'm tired of people contributing to the forces of evil here.

I'm really angry about this hate-proliferation agenda. Seriously, why do people think that all of a sudden it's their duty to police the behavior, identity, beliefs of others? I haven't been on the Facebook for a while, and I was just scrolling through my feed, and the number of hate crime incidents was ridiculous! 

One woman was beaten for looking "too masculine" and being in a ladies' bathroom. One woman was harassed for having "too short" of hair, apparently making her look "transgender" and someone felt she needed to be told she didn't belong. One woman was harassed, verbally, and filmed at the check out line, because she was grocery shopping while being in a body that wasn't defined as societally perfect. My fibro & other chronically-ill-with-invisible-illness friends are harassed for looking "normal" and using a handi-cap spot, or generally judged for just trying to live their lives the way they need to. One of my friends gets made fun of for having long hair and being a male - he donates it, not that it matters to anyone if he doesn't, but what makes you think you are correct in your assumptions about other people and the way they live? What makes one feel so strongly about putting others in their place? I am sick and tired of all the blatant and the subversive displays of hatred. 

_**What is up with the prevalence and justification of hatred?**_

_**I am here, and I am saying this, loud & clear - it's not okay! **_

It's not cool, or tough, or funny. It's not necessary, you're not doing justice to anything, the judgement does harm. You are hurting other people, and I won't stand idly by.

Want to know what has no place in a bathroom? Hatred! It has nothing to do with what goes on in there! If I'm out, and you don't feel safe using the facilities, I'll go with you. And if you're concerned about your children being in the bathroom with a person who doesn't fit your narrow idea of gender, then it's time for you to educate yourselves, and your children. 

Meanwhile, while all this hate is being spread, there are children being harmed - the ones who are now more likely to kill themselves because they don't fit your gender binary.   
You have the power to contribute to this world, are you using that power for good or evil?
