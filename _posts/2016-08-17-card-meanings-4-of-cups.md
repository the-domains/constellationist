  THE STORY: the rat is trying to protect what is his. Is he greedy? Not
  intentionally. He’s insecure, worried that he will have enough/that his needs
  will be met. He doesn’t know what he truly wants, so he holds on to what he
  has. The moon is shining down on him. It can reveal and release, if he
  examines what is in the cups/what he desires the cups to be filled with - in
  the light of the moon, the night, the shadow, within. What is he yearning for?
  He must ask himself this question.

THE STORY: the rat is trying to protect what is his. Is he greedy? Not intentionally. He's insecure, worried that he will have enough/that his needs will be met. He doesn't know what he truly wants, so he holds on to what he has. The moon is shining down on him. It can reveal and release, if he examines what is in the cups/what he desires the cups to be filled with - in the light of the moon, the night, the shadow, within. What is he yearning for? He must ask himself this question.

As part of the journaling challenge I'm doing, I'm supposed to focus on something different every time I study a card, try to find something new about it to understand it better. This time, I'm focusing on the crescent moon that's pictured. 

The moon on the card is a waning crescent, the last phase of the moon. It's meaning is to do with the importance of the inner realm at this time in the cycle. It represents a time of release - relationships, anxieties, etc. And this may show a time of peace, or emptiness (I don't interpret the word emptiness as a negative, as you might know, I'm quite invested in exploring the depths of emptiness and what it signals) 

Ah, I love confirmations.
