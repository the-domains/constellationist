I just got off the phone with my best friend. We talk about everything, paint colors to politics, and tonight, I was going off about my issue with "fundraising", and then how I'm donating a piece to a fundraiser for the [National Fibromyalgia and Chronic Pain Association ][0], and how I'm not a hypocrite for doing so...but I'll get into all that later...

[The Frida Center][1] is holding a silent art auction, and I made these Frida/Fibromyalgia necklaces before (_Frida is sort of my patron saint_). While I haven't ever met Dr. Liptan, I feel like I would be in the right place, if I could get to her center for treatment. I was crying watching the videos that they've posted from the center - like, watching them talk about the body and pain, the way I experience it, and knowing how this all works, what to do to help, and the fact that they GET IT, and no one, in the past 16 years has really GOTTEN IT... I want to go there. But for now, I'll read her upcoming book and happily support her work, and all the work that has been done by the NFMCPA. I hope that all good things come from this auction.

Here's the necklace I donated, it's one of my favorites. It has a wooden Frida Kahlo bead, an assortment of vintage glass and handmade beads, seed beads, garnets and fluorite, finished with a decorative clasp, and a purple tassel. The properties of the gemstones are to promote balance, healing, health, energy, stabilization, clarity, creativity, & hope. The color purple is said to calm nerves and promote creativity. The tassel is known to represent enlightenment, consciousness, and our connection to the divine and each other. I've combined all these elements with intention, to create a powerful statement piece. I hope that someone else finds this power in it too. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e3fdef23-2b44-4185-9735-e623652d86b1.jpg)

Now, for the reasons I have issues with fundraising. It seems to me that fundraising has become incredibly popular - everyone knows someone who is taking donations for one thing or another, and the ease of fundraising through the internet has fueled this. I am glad that people will show this kindness to others. I know people that it has made a huge difference for. I know that with Fibromyalgia, that awareness is really, truly needed. It makes a difference in the medical community and in the lives of all of us who deal with it every day. 

However, I feel like a lot of fundraising is just slapping a band aid over a gaping wound in society. It's great that we want to help pay for someone's medical bills, but then, why do I hear so much negativity about nationalized healthcare? I don't think that because someone has a large social network that they are more worthy of healthcare than others. I'm frustrated, because I know that there are people who are far less educated and capable than I am, who face harder decisions, who are no less worthy of being taken care of than anyone you know on Facebook. My story isn't tragic, it's full of invisible frustration and pain. I don't look "sick", or am a person who has had a bad accident that makes a good story for someone to buy into. I don't have a church or a bunch of same aged mothers to get behind me and rally together their support in the name of God or a team. I'm not jealous of those who do, I just want people to be aware that we're not fixing the problem, and that there are tons of people out there with less support and connections than me. It's not fair that the people who get help are those with stories that appeal to a certain demographic, or are part of a certain affiliation. 

I believe in donating to good causes, in helping people, I just wish we would focus more on preventing situations that are so incredibly dire, rather than fundraising to help people in the aftermath. 

Everyone is worthy of wellness and care. Why don't we make this a right in this country? 

_**It is absolutely out of love that I want to log in to my Facebook, and see ZERO go fund me pages for medical expenses.**_
