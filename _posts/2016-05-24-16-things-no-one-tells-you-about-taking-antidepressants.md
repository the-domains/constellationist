I'm glad that in other countries, ads have been banned for medications - they've found it's simply not in the interest of public health and well being! For anyone who struggles with an illness, you know that trying medications is a particularly afflicted process full of grappling for clarity to reach a decision over a length of time on whether something helps you and/or if the side effects are worth it.
