  It can be frustrating to deal with all the misinformation about what
  medications do, and how they make you feel. I like to explain meds as tools we

  for you!

I'm glad that in other countries, ads have been banned for medications - they've found it's simply not in the interest of public health and well being! For anyone who struggles with an illness, you know that trying medications is a particularly afflicted process full of grappling for clarity to reach a decision over a length of time on whether something helps you and/or if the side effects are worth it.
