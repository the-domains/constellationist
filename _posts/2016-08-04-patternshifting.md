# \#PATTERNSHIFTING

When I see a pattern that's not functioning for someone's highest good, I want them to be able to change it. It's difficult for me to know where or how to approach certain things - I can see the pattern in play before the person gets to the part where it hurts them. Some of these occurrences seem unimportant, but it's their overall combined effect that is so powerful. There are hundreds of years of influence on our behaviors that we're not totally aware of.

Our patterns are not solely of our conscious choosing. However, if we are able to bring our awareness to the dysfunction of the pattern in our lives, we can choose differently in the future. Our brains have amazing capability to change. 

When I studied art therapy, it stuck with me that it is scientifically proven that therapy can change the brain. It's the practice of bringing awareness to our dysfunctional patterns and choosing differently. It's creating the opportunity for this to happen in a safe and supportive environment. It's one of those things that I've internally known to be true, but people doubt it's validity; it empowers me to say, "Yes, but, SCIENCE!"

This all brings me to a little project I'm calling _**\#PATTERNSHIFTING**_

After observing scenarios that I encounter in some aspect, I'll be addressing the dysfunctional pattern, talking about ways to be more mindful of this happening, and offering some examples on more functional patterns to adapt.
