The moon was beautiful when I did yoga in the yard at 6 AM, all round, surrounded by glowy mist, behind gently swaying branches in warm air. My card of the day today was the empress, which I just happened to read before heading outside. The direction of this card is literally to "find the moon". 

This card points to a need to love more, and love without binding. I think about the relationships between me, the moon, the earth, and everything in between. I stand in the glow of the moon, and it does not expect anything from me for all it gives. Such an important lesson to carry into all aspects of our lives. 

The idea of loving more definitely resonates within me as well, I feel adrift without these deep connections of the heart. But it also applies to myself. Loving without binding speaks about letting go of expectations, and accepting what is. 

My dreams keep reflecting the feeling that I am not doing enough - I feel overwhelmed by everything I am doing, it's actually a lot - but dream me is holding on to unrealistic expectations. My dreams seem as though everything is affected by Murphy's Law, and everyone is angry/disappointed with me about it, though it's all beyond my control. Ah, yes. Some things are clearer when reflected upon by the light of the moon. 

_**Love more, and let it all flow.**_
