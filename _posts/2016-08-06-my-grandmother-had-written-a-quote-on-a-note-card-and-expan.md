  My grandmother had written a quote on a note card, and expanded upon it; the
  overall idea, that we should respect that people know what they need. My
  grandma and I have always been close, and I know that in her 80’s now, she
  struggles with people thinking they know what is best for her. She’s suffered
  with a chronic illness since I was younger, and we were discussing how we have
  to make way more decisions than most people in a day’s time, about what we can
  and cannot do. We’re more sensitive to things, and have limited energy. We
  have to put a value on activities that other people take for granted.

My grandmother had written a quote on a note card, and expanded upon it; the overall idea, that we should respect that people know what they need. My grandma and I have always been close, and I know that in her 80's now, she struggles with people thinking they know what is best for her. She's suffered with a chronic illness since I was younger, and we were discussing how we have to make way more decisions than most people in a day's time, about what we can and cannot do. We're more sensitive to things, and have limited energy. We have to put a value on activities that other people take for granted. 

When you're extra sensitive, I think it's mighty possible that you're more in tune with your intuition - I am ALWAYS paying attention to how I feel. Being an INFP personality type, this is also how I process everything, and understand the world around me. When someone else tells me what they need, for example, to lie down, because they don't feel well, I TRUST them. I believe that they know this is what they need to do. So it's incredibly frustrating to always have people doubting that you know what is best for yourself in any given moment. 

I understand that people make mistakes, and that we're human, and not always in tune with our intuition. We are distracted by everything, and have weird, non-beneficial patterns of behavior that get in the way. There are, however, lessons that we have to learn for ourselves sometimes. Supporting people doesn't look like telling them they're wrong, supporting people looks like asking them questions in a caring, exploratory way. People won't just listen to you because you say so - you have to help them see the picture, and acknowledge that your opinion of their situation is just that, your opinion, and ultimately, your loved one has to make the choice for themselves. You need to support them, even if they make the wrong choice! Maybe what they needed was to learn a lesson that you don't understand. The universe is huge, and we can totally help each other advance individually and collectively for the greater good, but we have to do it lovingly, or we're contributing to creating negative patterns of behavior all over. 

At a peak point in the breakdown of my wellness, I knew I couldn't go to work - I was barely functioning. I already couldn't drive, and was on a bunch of meds to get me through the day. I was working a specific schedule, and had been communicating everything with my doctors, my employer - the HR department, my immediate co-workers, and manager. I was riding with my mother to work, because we were going the same direction, and I had tried to call her to tell her I wasn't able to go in, but she didn't answer. She came to my house, about 5 min. away, and on her way to her job, and was angry at me when I stumbled out of the house and told her I wasn't going in that day. Looking back, I was an absolute mess, and I have no idea how I was doing anything at all, but instead of acting with support, she was angry with me, and sternly told me that I "better figure something out!".

Talk about not being helpful. Her doubt and anger towards my decision about what I needed only hurt me, when I was at a terrible point already. Being sick is NOT MY FAULT. I don't have control over it. I just have control over the decisions I make, that could affect how I feel, and only I can know that.

If you get angry with a family member for being ill, and choosing to stay in bed, you might want to ask yourself why you feel that way. 

If you think you know something that's better for someone you love, how can you present that option while maintaining respect for their self knowledge? 

If you judge a decision as a poor one, remember that you don't know what their options were - emotionally, physically, psychologically, societally...

We can all do better at this, and it starts with knowing and trusting our selves.
