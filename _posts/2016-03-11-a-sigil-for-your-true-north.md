Sometimes, life can leave you spinning. In those moments, it can be difficult to remember your true direction. Do you know what drives your temporary goals? What drives your heart? If you can hold onto that bearing, nothing can really get you off track from your authentic purpose/existence. To help myself refocus my energy, I created this sigil to _know my true north - _that direction beyond the goals, that drives you, and is connected to your intuition.

Use this sigil for meditation, journaling, marking your path, and realizing your intention.
