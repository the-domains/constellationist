description: "When you wake up at 5 AM, with pain shooting through your neck, and achy tightness all through you neck, shoulders, and back, it's not exactly the \"right side of the bed\". I stretch and move - I feel all rusted shut angles, trying to pry everything open so I can breathe. Everything hurts. I stretch and my bladder aches sharply. I step out of bed, pain shoots up my legs from my feet - specifically, the way my muscles are all pulled so taught, it's like my bones are hitting the floor with my nerves in between. I go pee, and it hurts, because my bladder is muscle and connective tissue, it's all tight and pulled and stretched. It aches like it's been over-extended for days, but I was just up a few hours before. I stretch my chest through the doorway, once, twice, trying to breathe.\_"

When you wake up at 5 AM, with pain shooting through your neck, and achy tightness all through you neck, shoulders, and back, it's not exactly the "right side of the bed". I stretch and move - I feel all rusted shut angles, trying to pry everything open so I can breathe. Everything hurts. I stretch and my bladder aches sharply. I step out of bed, pain shoots up my legs from my feet - specifically, the way my muscles are all pulled so taught, it's like my bones are hitting the floor with my nerves in between. I go pee, and it hurts, because my bladder is muscle and connective tissue, it's all tight and pulled and stretched. It aches like it's been over-extended for days, but I was just up a few hours before. I stretch my chest through the doorway, once, twice, trying to breathe. 

I think about how frustrating it is to be in so much pain, how insurances don't cover the actual treatments that help, and doctors don't really know what to do. I wish that they could wake up like this, just one morning, and realize that this is what I feel like, in some variation, EVERY DAY. 

There are so many kinds of pain that I'm in, and I've gotten better at understanding it, describing it, feeling it, to try to unfeel it... There is allodynia - when the skin hurts - like how sometimes the water falling from the shower head feels like hail pelting me, and how my husbands hands feel like asphalt on my skin. There is the pain that comes from constantly constricted, dehydrated muscles and connective tissue, it aches, and pulls on the ache, stretches the ache, but doesn't ever release it. There is the nerve pain, at the ends of these stretched muscle aches, deep under the layers of muscle, attached to my bones, all the points of connection - all that connective tissue is under so much stress, that there is a slight delay, so my brain, oh, wild brain, it amplifies it to make up for it. It SCREAMS at me - a tap on the shoulder, like lightning jolting down my nerve, it hits my brain - I can feel that not as a tap on my skin, but a zap up a nerve, directly to my brain - it shouts... The pulling is like creaking, straining, too much weight on a taught bridge. Headaches, pinched nerves, migraines result. Exhaustion, because my body is doing so much, even though you can't see any of it. Mental fatigue, adrenal fatigue, distraction, mood issues, anxiety, depression - you'd have them too, if this were you, every day.

It takes EVERYTHING I've got, just to try to feel "better".
