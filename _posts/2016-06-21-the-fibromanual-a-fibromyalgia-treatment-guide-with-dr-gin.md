Here's a great podcast with Dr. Ginevra Liptan, where she covers a lot of the points of effective treatment for Fibromyalgia.

It's so good to hear her address the systemic issues that have affected Fibro patients - it makes me feel way less crazy than I felt for the first 10 years I searched for help. Dr. Liptan states that the neglect of this disease is in part because it affects mostly WOMEN, who look "fine", which has led to a lack of research, and lack of knowledge of what Fibromyalgia is, and how to treat it.

THANK YOU. I knew it wasn't just in my head that most of the doctors I saw dismissed my pain and illness because I was a woman, young, and looked "normal". These doctors do SO much damage! Seriously - when you have this chronic stress response, and going to the doctor actually causes you to go into a flare, you are more inclined not to go. It would be better if these doctors would listen, and admit they don't know. At least we wouldn't feel so crazy and put down as their patients.

Speaking of doctors not knowing, it's long been reiterated that there isn't knowledge of what Fibromyalgia is or what causes it, or how to treat it. Listen up, because that's just not true!

Dr. Liptan also discusses why Fibromyalgia is a disease and not a syndrome, the best approaches to treating and what not to do, as well as the best methods for managing pain. Also, she truly seems to understand the myriad of symptoms, and how to address what - not just by covering them up, but by restoring the body systems and striving to maintain that balance. NOW, to continue my search to assemble a care team for myself that is willing to understand... UGH. If I could go to Portland right now, I'd be there, with a giant hug for this woman...
