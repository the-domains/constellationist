Thinking about it now, I'm not sure that there were many other kids making mix tapes when they were 6... so it's not a surprise to me that there exists research on how music therapy can help fibromyalgia patients. It has always helped me, whether it was intentional or not. Some studies show that music, along with guided meditation, is effective in helping fibromyalgia patients manage their pain. I think there is definitely power in setting that intention, consciously entering into a state of awareness of the energy of the music, allowing and willing it to affect your energy."

Music has always been a huge part of my existence. Thinking about it now, I'm not sure that there were many other kids making mix tapes when they were 6... so it's not a surprise to me that there exists research on how music therapy can help fibromyalgia patients. It has always helped me, whether it was intentional or not. Some studies show that music, along with guided meditation, is effective in helping fibromyalgia patients manage their pain.

In my experience, all good music will make you feel something. I make different playlists to affect different energies - there's music for my melancholy aches, and music for my optimistic hopeful feelings, and music to help me lift my mood when I want to get out of a funk. I've got music to help me focus - this one is important when I'm working, it helps me feel sharper and less foggy. I have a playlist for when I'm in a lot of pain and I can't function. I find that even when other sensory sensitivities are extreme, that there is music that will help soothe my nerves. It actually overrides my pain signals and makes them less intense. If you don't make time to listen to music, you might want to try incorporating more of it in your life - it's not expensive, and there aren't dangerous side effects.
