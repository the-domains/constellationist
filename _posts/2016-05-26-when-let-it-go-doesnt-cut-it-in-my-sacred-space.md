Ash at In My Sacred Space - I FEEL YOU 

She goes on to discuss why it's not so great to tell someone to "let it go", and how the process of letting something go is different for everyone, in every situation. You might want to let something go, but it's taking you time to work through it, and that's okay, sometimes you can let things go, and sometimes you have to feel all the feelings about something before you're done with it. 

When you're going through something, you need acceptance from those close to you. You need them to accept your feelings and help you without judgement. Telling them to "let it go" isn't favorable because you're invalidating their experience. I'm pretty sure they didn't go to you for you to do that.
