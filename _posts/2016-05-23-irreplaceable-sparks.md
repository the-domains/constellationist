I have a deep reserve of feeling for teens and young adults. They're actually my favorite population to photograph. See, I had a REALLY difficult time BEING a teenager/young adult, and I'm not apt to forget that. 

We, as a society, expect teens to act like adults, but don't want to treat them like individual people. It's ridiculous, and I have no idea why people have children, and expect them not to be individual people. I don't get why it's so difficult to appreciate them for that, instead of getting angry when they express it. 

Guess what? If you have children, they are going to have their own thoughts and forms of expression. They are going to be different than you, and live their age in a different time than you - don't be angry at them for that, it's how life works. Your expectations for them and your ideas of who or what they should be are only frameworks from your mind, you can't be mad and take it out on them when they don't fit your boxes. Guidelines are great, and yes, expectations are part of parenting, but hold them loosely, and expect that everything will change. 

I feel like a parent's job, our job as people in general, is to encourage one another to be our best selves. My heart goes out to people when their parents are too busy holding on to their ideas to show up for their kids in a loving way.

For SERIOUS, look at these beautiful young people - _admirable for their strength and capability, their ability to choose love over fear_. I would show up for these people, even though I'm not their parent - they can borrow my maternal-love-energy, because I'm dang proud of them, and I HOPE that their parents learn to let go of their hang ups and love their kids!!!

If I could support you by showing up and taking some photos, giving some hugs, and sharing my love, _please let me know_. My darling teenage people, if your families don't show up for you, don't give up, you just haven't met your people yet. I'm happy to be your cheerleader. 

_LOVE, LOVE, LOVE - the constellationist_
