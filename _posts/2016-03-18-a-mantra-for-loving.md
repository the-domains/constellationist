These words have become a personal mantra. I was studying the way the energy of words affects us, and came upon this simple, yet profound assertion. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/14f65914-654b-458f-97f6-590b2ca9a7ae.jpg)

_BE LOVE_ - in all my actions, my thoughts, my words, in my heart, I choose to embody a loving energy.  I am loving kindness in my heart, mind, and spirit. My intention is set to choose love at every opportunity.

_BELOVED_ - remember, you are loved - you are beloved to others, to the universe, and to your self. You are worthy. You are complete. You are infinite. You are part of everything. 

I see these terms as applying inward and outward. You are worthy of love, and are capable of choosing love. Be secure in your authenticity, your value, your capabilities. Know that your existence on all the spectrums is unique and valuable.  We exist at this point, to shine from it, connected to everything else. 

These terms also play out together, like two sides of a coin.  In situations where you might take things personally, you are able to acknowledge that you're loved, you are secure. This makes you capable of transcending the ego when these triggers arise, allowing you to choose love. 

Use this mantra as your own in those moments you need a reminder. When you feel your defenses creeping up, your anger, fear, and pain... and you don't want to give in to these feelings. Use these words to find acceptance and transcendence. 

_BE LOVE, BELOVED._
