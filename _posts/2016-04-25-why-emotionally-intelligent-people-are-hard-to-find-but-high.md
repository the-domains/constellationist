Just read this article about emotional intelligence. \#ifeelthesameway  
I refer to myself as, "not a surface dweller". I have a difficult time carrying on in that realm - it's not the stuff that matters, and I _need _to connect with other dwellers of the deep.   
I thought the author summed up the characteristics of emotional intelligence quite well, so here they are - and you can click to read the full article... 

_"1\. Self-awareness- knowing your emotions, recognizing feelings as they occur, and discriminating between them_

_2\. Mood management- handling feelings so they're relevant to the current situation and you react appropriately_

_3\. Empathy- recognizing feelings in others and tuning into their verbal and nonverbal cues_

_4\. Managing relationships- handling interpersonal interaction, conflict resolution, and negotiations_

_5\. Self-motivation- "gathering up" your feelings and directing yourself toward a goal, despite self-doubt, inertia, and impulsiveness"_

<article style=""><h1>Why emotionally intelligent people are hard to find but highly sought after.</h1><p>I recently attended a reunion, after nearly a decade that had passed between last meeting these individuals, it only took ten minutes with them to remind me why I rarely felt 'part' of their social world and hadn't missed them at all in that time.</p><img src="http://iheartintelligence.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/emotionally-intelligent-people.jpg" /></article>
