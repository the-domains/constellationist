_**"the phrase "just saying" after an off-putting remark apparently gives the speaker a free pass to say anything and then magically negate any ill intent." -[Lynn Margolies, Ph.D.][0]**_

I guess people find this funny, to say something mean, and add, "just saying" to the end of it, as though that makes it okay. I saw a video on my news feed, commented on and liked by lots of my "Christian" family members, where a larger woman, wearing a bikini, who was presumably drunk, was toppled over and over by the ocean waves and couldn't get up. It was reposted with something like, " I'll probably go to hell for this, but it's too funny...just saying!"

It's like prefacing a racist statement with, "I'm not racist, but..." 

It's similar to the tactics that the current republican party presidential candidate employs, to pretend that the other party is offended easily because he isn't politically correct. Where in fact, his tactics are to detract from the fact that his "political incorrectness" is actually racism. 

_**This method of passive-aggressive speaking tries to place the blame of offense onto the offended party, and not the responsibility of the speaker. **_  
Yes, we all have free speech in this country, but it doesn't mean that we are free from the consequences of it. 

Please be aware of this phrase, and others like it, that seem to be gaining popularity increasingly. If you use these words, please be aware of your intent. Think about what your goal is with this phrase, and if it's something worth pursuing or a habit worth breaking. 

We all benefit when we remember where our power lies, and speak with kindness and authenticity.
