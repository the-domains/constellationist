No matter who you are, and who you're in a relationship with, conflict is bound to arise. It's just part of being in any relationship.  People have asked my husband and I over the years how we get along so well. There are many facets to that, but to put it simply, _**knowing how to fight, and what is worth fighting for is the key. **_

Many people see the conflict, they see their side, and even if they don't want to consider it, they see the other person's side. They see and feel the disagreement, and are capable of arguing their perspective. They feel that they are having a conversation about the problem - but really, they aren't. 

I'm going to ask you to spiral out a bit here, because the problem ISN'T the problem. _**The actual problem is the pattern. **_

We're all existing on these spectrums, and they can narrate our experiences, forming patterns - how we view situations, how we react. These patterns tend to control the scope of our behavior if we aren't aware of them. Even then, they can be difficult to change when they've formed beliefs we have held for a long time. _(This is why therapy is amazing)_

Conflict occurs when two patterns don't fit together. It's bound to happen, because we ALL have our unique set of experiences in this life. Another aspect is the awareness of our patterns, the patterns of others, and the perspective you can gain about a situation from this knowledge. When you are capable of this awareness, you see that things aren't so personal. You can see these pattern breakdowns as just that, and more information gives you more informed choices - lots of times, people aren't angry with us, they're angry about something within themselves - and now you might be in a position to help them change this. Saying, "Hey, our patterns really aren't fitting together right now, what can we do to adjust?" is a powerful tool. Even if you can't say those actual words to another person, the knowledge of this can help you decide how to proceed.

**We can benefit so much, personally, in relationships, in society, if we can help one another shift our perspectives with kindness and support. THIS IS WHAT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR.**

So when those gear teeth are grinding - it hurts, or someone is upset - ask yourself, "What am I fighting for?" Is it working towards a pattern resolution, or is it just squabbling over the effect? Call attention to the real issue. Both parties need to listen, and be heard. Engage only in considerate conversation. _**You are capable of being mad as hell, AND treating someone with kindness.**_I've experienced it, and it ALWAYS works out better.
