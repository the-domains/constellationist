# Clean up, aisle misogyny...

It's Friday, and I'm considering going to our local game shop to play Magic: The Gathering. I have to get this out before I go, because, someone help me if I can't contain my rage mid-game. 

Let me be clear, my rage has nothing to do with the actual game. I have a great time playing, win or lose. Except that it's hard to focus on playing when the dudes behind you are talking about rape, or objectifying women (discussing lesbian sex, because obviously, it's about how men perceive it!). I want to say something, but it won't help, because they don't respect me anyway. I just look like "a crazy feminist". (Side note: if you know and love me, this is part of why you do!)

But they do respect my husband. 

So we were playing the other night, and like a normal human being, after being there and playing for a few hours, consuming snacks and beverages from the vending machines, I had to pee. I also thought I might be getting my period. Trust me, if I didn't have to use that bathroom, I wouldn't. 

I've had to ask for paper towels, toilet paper, and hand soap more times than I can count. I usually say something like, " I'm sorry, I don't want to be a pain, but could I get some paper towels to dry my hands? The bathroom is out again." It's like a big thing apparently. I've suggested that the owner stock the bathroom with more than one roll. I've also suggested that the bathroom get cleaned. I've also straight up said, "Your bathroom is disgusting". 

To be clear, I grew up in a town that didn't even have sewerage until the late 80's. I remember using outhouses and the pot at my gram's. I'm not stuck up. I just think bathrooms for your patrons should be cleaned - and have toilet paper.

I'm always met with some kind of, "yeah, yeah" response, and they hand me the thing I was asking for, along with some excuse about how fast everyone uses stuff. Maybe install one of those brown paper roll dispensers, or a hand dryer? I'm always full of solutions, but no one seems to care. I can't be the only patron this annoys. 

I got up from my seat, and went to the bathroom, and the light wasn't on - the guy running the shop had turned off the lights at the front because he was playing D&D. I went over and said, "Hey (guy), I can't pee in the dark".

He looks at me, and says, "Well everyone else just uses their phones"

I stand there looking at him. 

One guy is like, here, you can use mine, and another guy pulls a flashlight out of his bag and tells me I can use it. I say, "Thanks, but I wouldn't want to sit those down ANYWHERE in there". I'm trying to imagine a possible scenario where I could go and hold the flashlight...

(Guy) says, annoyed, "I could go turn on the light"

I am shocked that he's making such a big deal, "Yeah, that would be great, thanks".

The other lady there says that she just takes her phone in and sets it on the sink. 

I want to say, "Well I kind of need to see, one, to make sure I'm not sitting in anything disgusting, and two, because I need to make sure I'm not bleeding from my vagina". 

I quietly seethe. (Guy) makes a big deal about having to try the lights to see which one it is, saying something about me having to check if they turn on and let him know. I give him a thumbs up and go pee. I do not have my period yet, for the record. There is soap and toilet paper, but no paper towels. I walk out with wet hands, afraid to ask for paper towels, because clearly, asking for LIGHTS was something worth causing a scene over. 

My husband looks at me, "Don't say anything".

This is his cautionary plea, because he knows it's not worth it, and I'm not feeling well, and it will be draining on me if I get more upset, and he wasn't even sure what I heard. I smirk at him and ask if I can dry my hands on his shirt. He says sure. I joke that I'm packing a Sheldon Cooper public restroom kit to take next time. 

We finished up the last game and headed home. I ask my husband, "What did you think I was going to say?" 

He asks me, "What did you hear?"

Apparently, after I went into the bathroom, someone asked why (Guy) made an exception to turn the lights on for me, when he doesn't for anyone else. He said, he doesn't know me well enough to be a dick to me. And someone said something about my husband would probably kill him in one punch if he did. 

Newsflash. He WAS a dick to me. He made a scene out of me asking him to turn the bathroom light on, like peeing in the dark is normal and I'm being ridiculous. You know what, even the outhouse had a moon crescent in the door to let the light in at night. 

_But this isn't even about bathrooms. _

Hearing that people are moved to treat me, um, more respectfully? because my they respect my husband just fuels the fire. THEY SO DON'T GET IT. 

You shouldn't not be a dick because you fear my husband punching your face in.

You shouldn't not be a dick because you don't "know me well enough"

You should just not be a dick, because no one likes that guy, not even that guy, deep down. And that's definitely not how you want to treat your patrons...

You should also know that the issues I have with the bathroom aren't just me being picky. WHILE I LOOK FINE, I have a chronic illness. I have terrible night vision. I have difficulty holding things. I actually couldn't have successfully held a light and went to the bathroom. Also, I have a lot of pain in my connective tissue, including my bladder area, which equals having to pee more frequently than "normal". The thought of having to explain all of this in front of all the people there, to persuade someone to turn the lights on so I could use the bathroom, made me feel like crying. 

I need to write this all out because the entire environment NEEDS TO CHANGE. I don't want to seem demanding for asking for normal things. I don't want to hear about sexual abuse being performed on women like it's nothing, while I'm trying to play. I don't want any of the kids who come into the shop, and hear this crap being said, think that this is an acceptable way to treat women. I don't want other women to feel like it's okay for them to be treated this way. I don't want to put up with the insidious misogyny ANY LONGER. And I have no idea how to approach it.
