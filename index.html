The moon is shining down on him. It can reveal and release, if he examines what is in the cups/what he desires the cups to be filled with - in the light of the moon, the night, the shadow, within.

He must ask himself this question.</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="69"><p>As part of the journaling challenge I’m doing, I’m supposed to focus on something different every time I study a card, try to find something new about it to understand it better.

It’s meaning is to do with the importance of the inner realm at this time in the cycle. It represents a time of release - relationships, anxieties, etc. And this may show a time of peace, or emptiness (I don’t interpret the word emptiness as a negative, as you might know, I’m quite invested in exploring the depths of emptiness and what it signals) </p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="71"><p>Ah, I love confirmations.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_Graphical-e4eb67c8-284a-47dd-b34b-d740b27ef76e" class="Section Section--components-1 p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="72"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="73"><div class="Group Group--graphical max-w-768px p-1 m-h-a" data-reactid="74"><a href="https://constellationist.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/a-tarot-wish-list/" class=" " data-reactid="75"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="76"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="77"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b9c79166694a978d2871405bbb66dff2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb099a4b6f801bc195a1aeaf75d281790ac75de7c.jpg&amp;width=665" style="object-position:51.28054511278195% 62.695818928262746%;" data-reactid="78"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b9c79166694a978d2871405bbb66dff2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb099a4b6f801bc195a1aeaf75d281790ac75de7c.jpg&amp;width=665" style="object-position:51.28054511278195% 62.695818928262746%;" data-reactid="79"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b9c79166694a978d2871405bbb66dff2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb099a4b6f801bc195a1aeaf75d281790ac75de7c.jpg&amp;width=665" style="object-position:51.28054511278195% 62.695818928262746%;" data-reactid="80"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d257668fdd4284e7331c1de59e581ba8/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb099a4b6f801bc195a1aeaf75d281790ac75de7c.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:51.28054511278195% 62.695818928262746%;" data-reactid="81"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="665" data-height="1157" data-ratio="0.57476231633535" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b9c79166694a978d2871405bbb66dff2/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fb099a4b6f801bc195a1aeaf75d281790ac75de7c.jpg&amp;width=665" style="object-position:51.28054511278195% 62.695818928262746%;" data-reactid="82"/></picture></div></a><!-- react-empty: 83 --><!-- react-empty: 84 --><!-- react-empty: 85 --></div></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-c5bdc981-70bb-41a4-a124-beb6335668a8" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="86"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="87"><picture>

</picture><p>My grandmother had written a quote on a note card, and expanded upon it; the overall idea, that we should respect that people know what they need. My grandma and I have always been close, and I know that in her 80’s now, she struggles with people thinking
    they know what is best for her. She’s suffered with a chronic illness since I was younger, and we were discussing how we have to make way more decisions than most people in a day’s time, about what we can and cannot do. We’re more sensitive to things,
    and have limited energy. We have to put a value on activities that other people take for granted. </p><p>When you’re extra sensitive, I think it’s mighty possible that you’re more in tune with your intuition - I am ALWAYS paying attention to how I feel. Being an INFP personality type, this is also how I process everything, and understand the world around
    me. When someone else tells me what they need, for example, to lie down, because they don’t feel well, I TRUST them. I believe that they know this is what they need to do. So it’s incredibly frustrating to always have people doubting that you know
    what is best for yourself in any given moment. </p><p>I understand that people make mistakes, and that we’re human, and not always in tune with our intuition. We are distracted by everything, and have weird, non-beneficial patterns of behavior that get in the way. There are, however, lessons that we have
    to learn for ourselves sometimes. Supporting people doesn’t look like telling them they’re wrong, supporting people looks like asking them questions in a caring, exploratory way. People won’t just listen to you because you say so - you have to help
    them see the picture, and acknowledge that your opinion of their situation is just that, your opinion, and ultimately, your loved one has to make the choice for themselves. You need to support them, even if they make the wrong choice! Maybe what they
    needed was to learn a lesson that you don’t understand. The universe is huge, and we can totally help each other advance individually and collectively for the greater good, but we have to do it lovingly, or we’re contributing to creating negative
    patterns of behavior all over. </p><p>At a peak point in the breakdown of my wellness, I knew I couldn’t go to work - I was barely functioning. I already couldn’t drive, and was on a bunch of meds to get me through the day. I was working a specific schedule, and had been communicating everything
    with my doctors, my employer - the HR department, my immediate co-workers, and manager. I was riding with my mother to work, because we were going the same direction, and I had tried to call her to tell her I wasn’t able to go in, but she didn’t answer.
    She came to my house, about 5 min. away, and on her way to her job, and was angry at me when I stumbled out of the house and told her I wasn’t going in that day. Looking back, I was an absolute mess, and I have no idea how I was doing anything at
    all, but instead of acting with support, she was angry with me, and sternly told me that I “better figure something out!”.</p><p>Talk about not being helpful. Her doubt and anger towards my decision about what I needed only hurt me, when I was at a terrible point already. Being sick is NOT MY FAULT. I don’t have control over it. I just have control over the decisions I make, that
    could affect how I feel, and only I can know that.</p><p>If you get angry with a family member for being ill, and choosing to stay in bed, you might want to ask yourself why you feel that way. </p><p>If you think you know something that’s better for someone you love, how can you present that option while maintaining respect for their self knowledge? </p><p>If you judge a decision as a poor one, remember that you don’t know what their options were - emotionally, physically, psychologically, societally…</p><p>We can all do better at this, and it starts with knowing and trusting our selves.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="88"><!-- react-empty: 89 --></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual-331ca93f-52fe-4914-9a0d-e60d719c1fe6" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="90"><div class="Component ms-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="91"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="92"><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="93"><h1 data-reactid="94"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="95"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="96">#PATTERNSHIFTING</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 97 --><!-- react-empty: 98 --><!-- react-empty: 99 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="100"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="101"><p>When I see a pattern that’s not functioning for someone’s highest good, I want them to be able to change it.

Also, I have a lot of pain in my connective tissue, including my bladder area, which equals having to pee more frequently than “normal”.

I don’t want any of the kids who come into the shop, and hear this crap being said, think that this is an acceptable way to treat women. I don’t want other women to feel like it’s okay for them to be treated this way. I don’t want to put up with the insidious misogyny ANY LONGER.
