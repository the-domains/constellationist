<p>My grandmother had written a quote on a note card, and expanded upon it; the overall idea, that we should respect that people know what they need. My grandma and I have always been close, and I know that in her 80’s now, she struggles with people thinking they know what is best for her. She’s suffered with a chronic illness since I was younger, and we were discussing how we have to make way more decisions than most people in a day’s time, about what we can and cannot do. We’re more sensitive to things, and have limited energy. We have to put a value on activities that other people take for granted. </p><p>When you’re extra sensitive, I think it’s mighty possible that you’re more in tune with your intuition - I am ALWAYS paying attention to how I feel. Being an INFP personality type, this is also how I process everything, and understand the world around me. When someone else tells me what they need, for example, to lie down, because they don’t feel well, I TRUST them. I believe that they know this is what they need to do. So it’s incredibly frustrating to always have people doubting that you know what is best for yourself in any given moment. </p><p>I understand that people make mistakes, and that we’re human, and not always in tune with our intuition. We are distracted by everything, and have weird, non-beneficial patterns of behavior that get in the way. There are, however, lessons that we have to learn for ourselves sometimes. Supporting people doesn’t look like telling them they’re wrong, supporting people looks like asking them questions in a caring, exploratory way. People won’t just listen to you because you say so - you have to help them see the picture, and acknowledge that your opinion of their situation is just that, your opinion, and ultimately, your loved one has to make the choice for themselves. You need to support them, even if they make the wrong choice! Maybe what they needed was to learn a lesson that you don’t understand. The universe is huge, and we can totally help each other advance individually and collectively for the greater good, but we have to do it lovingly, or we’re contributing to creating negative patterns of behavior all over. </p><p>At a peak point in the breakdown of my wellness, I knew I couldn’t go to work - I was barely functioning. I already couldn’t drive, and was on a bunch of meds to get me through the day. I was working a specific schedule, and had been communicating everything with my doctors, my employer - the HR department, my immediate co-workers, and manager. I was riding with my mother to work, because we were going the same direction, and I had tried to call her to tell her I wasn’t able to go in, but she didn’t answer. She came to my house, about 5 min. away, and on her way to her job, and was angry at me when I stumbled out of the house and told her I wasn’t going in that day. Looking back, I was an absolute mess, and I have no idea how I was doing anything at all, but instead of acting with support, she was angry with me, and sternly told me that I “better figure something out!”.</p><p>Talk about not being helpful. Her doubt and anger towards my decision about what I needed only hurt me, when I was at a terrible point already. Being sick is NOT MY FAULT. I don’t have control over it. I just have control over the decisions I make, that could affect how I feel, and only I can know that.</p><p>If you get angry with a family member for being ill, and choosing to stay in bed, you might want to ask yourself why you feel that way. </p><p>If you think you know something that’s better for someone you love, how can you present that option while maintaining respect for their self knowledge? </p><p>If you judge a decision as a poor one, remember that you don’t know what their options were - emotionally, physically, psychologically, societally…</p><p>We can all do better at this, and it starts with knowing and trusting our selves.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="100"><!-- react-empty: 101 --></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="102"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="103"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="104"><!-- react-empty: 105 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="106"><h1 data-reactid="107"><span class=" color-box-pop" data-reactid="108"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="109">#PATTERNSHIFTING</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 110 --><!-- react-empty: 111 --><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="112"><p data-reactid="113">When I see a pattern that’s not functioning for someone’s highest good, I want them to be able to change it.

I usually say something like, “ I’m sorry, I don’t want to be a pain, but could I get some paper towels to dry my hands? The bathroom is out again.” It’s like a big thing apparently. I’ve suggested that the owner stock the bathroom with more than one roll. I’ve also suggested that the bathroom get cleaned.

(Guy) makes a big deal about having to try the lights to see which one it is, saying something about me having to check if they turn on and let him know. I give him a thumbs up and go pee. I do not have my period yet, for the record. There is soap and toilet paper, but no paper towels.

And someone said something about my husband would probably kill him in one punch if he did. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="174"><p data-reactid="175">Newsflash. He WAS a dick to me. He made a scene out of me asking him to turn the bathroom light on, like peeing in the dark is normal and I’m being ridiculous.

WHILE I LOOK FINE, I have a chronic illness. I have terrible night vision. I have difficulty holding things. I actually couldn’t have successfully held a light and went to the bathroom. Also, I have a lot of pain in my connective tissue, including my bladder area, which equals having to pee more frequently than “normal”. The thought of having to explain all of this in front of all the people there, to persuade someone to turn the lights on so I could use the bathroom, made me feel like crying. </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="188"><p data-reactid="189">I need to write this all out because the entire environment NEEDS TO CHANGE. I don’t want to seem demanding for asking for normal things. I don’t want to hear about sexual abuse being performed on women like it’s nothing, while I’m trying to play. I don’t want any of the kids who come into the shop, and hear this crap being said, think that this is an acceptable way to treat women. I don’t want other women to feel like it’s okay for them to be treated this way. I don’t want to put up with the insidious misogyny ANY LONGER. And I have no idea how to approach it. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="9" class="Section Section--components-1 p-1 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title section-bgcover-wo title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-left group-graphical-shape-none  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="190"><div class="Component j-c-center ls-fx-r fx-w-w a-i-start " data-reactid="191"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 fx-b-50p" data-reactid="192"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="193"><img class="color-loading" data-width="625" data-height="415" data-ratio="1.5060240963855422" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/d30a6b8e377e608800005ed8b0502e52/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F3146cfaeb733bc95289f86fa45207eae5851cfe6.jpg&amp;width=625" style="object-position:69.67999999999999% 65.66265060240963%;" data-reactid="194"/></div></div></div></section><section id="10" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-global " data-reactid="195"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="196"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="197"><!-- react-empty: 198 --><!-- react-empty: 199 --><!-- react-empty: 200 --><div class="Attribution " data-reactid="201"><h5 data-reactid="202"><span class="Author f-s-xxs  color-box-pop" data-reactid="203"><a href="http://www.drnaimon.com" data-reactid="204">Drnaimon</a></span></h5></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="205"><p data-reactid="206">Here’s a great podcast with Dr. Ginevra Liptan, where she covers a lot of the points of effective treatment for Fibromyalgia.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="207"><p data-reactid="208">It’s so good to hear her address the systemic issues that have affected Fibro patients - it makes me feel way less crazy than I felt for the first 10 years I searched for help.

I hope that all good things come from this auction.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="12" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-small color-title section-bgcover-wo p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-dark colors-local " data-reactid="237"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="238"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1 m-a" data-reactid="239"><div class="Cover ov-h pos-r" data-reactid="240"><button class="color-bg color-title pos-a circle w-4rem h-4rem center-hv m-0 cur-p" data-reactid="241"><span class="center-hv pos-a w-1rem h-1rem" data-reactid="242"><svg version="1.1" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="409.7 414 32.1 34.5" enable-background="new 409.7 414 32.1 34.5" xml:space="preserve"><polygon class="color-icon-pop" fill="#fff" points="418.6,448.5 441.8,431.3 418.6,414 "/></svg></span></button><img class="cur-p m-b-1" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9624c7cfd0d9d562365278ea03bd92ae/insta_brannan.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fimgflo.herokuapp.com%2Fgraph%2Fvahj1ThiexotieMo%2F3a0553e5c146d46d7490749b7dc8f943%2Fnoop.jpg%3Finput%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Ff4.bcbits.com%252Fimg%252Fa3965860040_5.jpg&amp;width=700" style="object-position:50.07142857142857% 122.07142857142857%;" data-reactid="243"/></div></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 color-title" data-reactid="244"><!-- react-empty: 245 --><!-- react-empty: 246 --><!-- react-empty: 247 --><div class="max-w-560px" data-reactid="248"><!-- react-text: 249 --> <!-- /react-text --><!-- react-empty: 250 --><h3 class="m-t-1 m-b-05 font-title undefined" data-reactid="251"><span data-reactid="252">Forever Beautiful: a collection of love for Orlando, by Various Artists</span></h3><div class="Attribution color-title2 undefined" data-reactid="253"><h5 data-reactid="254"><span class="Author color-title2" data-reactid="255"><a href="http://http://bandcamp.com" data-reactid="256">BandCamp</a></span></h5></div><div class="Paragraph l-h-m undefined" data-reactid="257">Forever Beautiful: a collection of love for Orlando by Various Artists, released 17 June 2016 1.
