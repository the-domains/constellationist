            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>the confusion of knowledge</h1><p>Someone sent me an article about how creative people's brains work differently. It was saying that the whole left brain, right brain thing is incorrect. Creative's brains are working making connections and working with both sides. The article pointed out that this is why creative people can understand and exist conflicting terms. Coupled with my...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>being dismissed ... things that irk</h1><p>There is a feeling of discomfort that comes with being dismissed as "new-agey" "hippy-dippy" etc. Someone on my Facebook feed posted this article: New Age Roommate Has A Crystal For That Which promptly got a series of likes from dudes, and "LOL" type comments. Being that the comments were from dudes and this article was...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>existing on the introversion - extroversion spectrum</h1><p>I just read Lifehack's 19 Real Life Examples of An Extroverted Introvert So You Don't Get Confused. It's an interesting topic. I never thought of myself as an introvert until more recent years. I've always enjoyed conversation and people. And then, I have this memory of being with my mother, and how someone was noting how...</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6775644edf10075b41fb84e0f1de6c0d1d3bcf18.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Being productive, and people wanting things from you</h1><p>Fibromyalgia is exhausting to have. That exhaustion permeates every aspect of my life. It's always accompanied by its BFF, pain, and dealing with both of them all the time is difficult.

If you remove the internet from our lives, it doesn't effectively change who we are. But it is a real extension of ourselves. It's our knowledge and connection.
