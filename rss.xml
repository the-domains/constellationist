            <title><![CDATA[A SIGIL FOR YOUR TRUE NORTH]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A SIGIL FOR YOUR TRUE NORTH</h1><p> Sometimes, life can leave you spinning. In those moments, it can be difficult to remember your true direction. Do you know what drives your temporary goals? What drives your heart? If you can hold onto that bearing, nothing can really get you off track from your authentic purpose/existence. To help myself refocus my energy, I created this sigil to know my true north - that direction beyond the goals, that drives you, and is connected to your intuition.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9136a2b4cdf7e35ede19e1985c957581683feff8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>WHAT IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR?</h1><p>No matter who you are, and who you're in a relationship with, conflict is bound to arise. It's just part of being in any relationship.  People have asked my husband and I over the years how we get along so well. There are many facets to that, but to put it simply, knowing how to fight, and what is worth fighting for is the key. </p></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[pointed wisdom]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>pointed wisdom</h1><p>My dad would say, "pay attention" in a commanding voice. I came to realize that his pointed (literally, he would point at you when he said it) phrase was his statement of "be here now". He was always focused on safety, and did things meticulously. He didn't care for the distractions that phones have brought into our lives. He would remind others to keep their mind on their task, and "safety first". They were important things when you're working in a coal mine, or with heavy machinery and tools, but this sentiment carried through his life, and he strived to impress this upon others.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/443c360ba7d047e1c29b9c9276f531fd4ab6b614.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[CHARIOT ENERGY]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>CHARIOT ENERGY</h1><p>Today I drew the chariot card, reversed, of course. It's just how things have been lately. The different meanings this could take on all point to the same thing - awareness of the chariot inside you.  The energy of this card is about the ideas of the will, confidence, focused energy, and the flow that occurs on the way to triumph. With that in mind,  I created this sigil from the word "TRIUMPH" to encompass the energy of the chariot and manifest it in my life. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3813300a7ef312f9d8054de436b425a2c4d06e6a.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[A SIGIL FOR LOVE & FREEDOM]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A SIGIL FOR LOVE & FREEDOM</h1><p>I'll be sharing more on sigils soon - but for now here is one with the intention of love and freedom. Use it to mark your intentions, and open your heart. The directional flow of this one really channels these energies - it's turned me around this morning, and I hope you find it useful too.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3c97fe35522db9de61bdf268ca6d2b3545de39d5.jpg"></article>]]></description>
