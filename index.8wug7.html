One woman was harassed, verbally, and filmed at the check out line, because she was grocery shopping while being in a body that wasn't defined as societally perfect. My fibro & other chronically-ill-with-invisible-illness friends are harassed for looking "normal" and using a handi-cap spot, or generally judged for just trying to live their lives the way they need to. One of my friends gets made fun of for having long hair and being a male - he donates it, not that it matters to anyone if he doesn't, but what makes you think you are correct in your assumptions about other people and the way they live? What makes one feel so strongly about putting others in their place?

I make different playlists to affect different energies - there's music for my melancholy aches, and music for my optimistic hopeful feelings, and music to help me lift my mood when I want
    to get out of a funk. I've got music to help me focus - this one is important when I'm working, it helps me feel sharper and less foggy. I have a playlist for when I'm in a lot of pain and I can't function. I find that even when other sensory sensitivities
    are extreme, that there is music that will help soothe my nerves. It actually overrides my pain signals and makes them less intense. If you don't make time to listen to music, you might want to try incorporating more of it in your life - it's not
    expensive, and there aren't dangerous side effects.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ls-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="103"><!-- react-empty: 104 --></div></section><section id="section-v_Column-302a5943-e017-421c-a4b1-b4cf5dcbd8cd" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-medium p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-black colors-local " data-reactid="105"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-1 " data-reactid="106"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 max-w-768px m-a" data-reactid="107"><!-- react-empty: 108 --><!-- react-empty: 109 --><!-- react-empty: 110 --><!-- react-empty: 111 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="112"><p>There are so many times that I want to speak up, but I've kept quiet, because I didn't feel it was my story to tell.  I share it now, with permission, in hopes that someone else might have that moment that helps them put everything in perspective, that this story adds to the development of our mutual understanding and collective empathy. </p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="113"><p>My husband and I have been together since we were in high school.
